    <h2>WORK EXPERIENCE</h2>
    <h3>August 2022 – March 2023</h3>
    <h3>Data Analyst (TDA) at the Department for Work and Pensions (CFCD)</h3>

    <p>
      As a data analyst at Universal Credit, I led the identification and
      resolution of complex analytical cases to minimise fraudulent claims. I
      employed various statistical methodologies such as hypothesis testing and
      cluster analysis to detect unusual patterns in claimants' behaviour that
      could indicate fraudulent activity. I presented my findings to senior
      leadership in the form of comprehensive reports and presentations, leading
      to the closure of batches of fraudulent claims and the initiation of
      further funds recovery. Additionally, I took on the role of upskilling
      junior team members in data manipulation and interpretation, which
      improved the team's overall efficiency and knowledge. My analytical
      approach and ability to teach others have resulted in significant cost
      savings and increased accuracy in fraudulent claim detection.
    </p>
    <h3>November 2020 – Present</h3>
    <h3>
      Executive Officer at the Department for Work and Pensions (Universal
      Credit)
    </h3>
    <p>
      As part of the Kickstart programme, I actively supported the government's
      efforts to reduce unemployment caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. I
      streamlined benefits and additional payment procedures, which helped us
      exceed KPI. As the current lead for the programme's reports, analysis, and
      overall project governance, I ensure the authenticity, accuracy, and
      up-to-date nature of data fed to the ministries. I guarantee fair support
      for each customer by analysing and investigating each case on an
      individual basis and following the current policies and procedures. I also
      identify, analyse, and escalate fraudulent activity to decision-makers,
      and collaborate with local authorities, councils, and service providers to
      deliver customised support to our customers.
    </p>

      I provided exceptional technical support and leadership.

        capable workforce.

    <h3>December 2018 – April 2019 (FTC)</h3>
    <h3>Project Manager at Penguin Random House</h3>
    I led a majour program that included office refurbishment, technology and
    network upgrades, and relocation of over 1000 employees. To ensure the
    success of the projects, I conducted regular meetings with project teams and
    external suppliers, closely monitored project plans and managed
    project-related governance, including risk and issue management and
    dependency identification. I worked closely with the company's PMO to ensure
    that all project activities adhered to company standards and policies.
    Additionally, I reviewed and approved quotations, purchase orders, and
    tender documentation to meet project requirements in terms of quality,
    budget, and lead time. Overall, my contributions helped ensure the timely
    and cost-effective delivery of the program while meeting high-quality
    standards.
    <h3>September 2017 – November 2018</h3>
    <h3>Purchasing Coordinator (Logistics) at JCDecaux</h3>
    <p>
      I was responsible for ensuring that the company's maintenance materials
      were available at the appropriate stock levels across all UK depots. I
      predicted and estimated the stock usage to place just-in-time (JIT)
      purchase orders, ensuring that the company's operations ran seamlessly. I
      maintained regular communication with suppliers and sought alternative
      options to reduce logistics and purchasing expenses while maintaining the
      required level of product quality and safety. I performed a cost analysis
      and comparison to choose the most cost-efficient option among the
      company's suppliers. In addition, I sourced new suppliers and established
      professional relationships with them.
    </p>

    <h3>May 2016 – September 2017</h3>
    <h3>Project Manager (relocations) at ENTJ Limited</h3>
    <p>
      I successfully coordinated and assisted in a variety of projects focused
      on business improvement, optimisation, and relocation. These projects
      involved data migration from older accounting/financial systems to cloud
      solutions or Windows servers, as well as the digitisation of archives and
      their storage in a database library for easy access and a reduction in
      unused office/storage areas, resulting in significant savings for the
      client. I created project schedules, including Gantt charts and detailed
      plans in MS Project, and liaised with stakeholders to address
      project-related issues. I diligently tracked project schedules and
      budgets, and sourced subcontractors and resources as needed to ensure
      successful project delivery.
